# ArduinoSerial_communication_Python
This project's basic aim is taking analog datas from Arduino to PC with Python. Python codes write analog data from Arduino to the text file with time data. Then, these text file datas are readed by interface code. All these datas are collected in simple interface data menu. There are datas and datas' graphs in this menu.( In this project Arduino Nano and one potentiometer are used for analog data)
